        <p><span>Is it possible to be at odds with yourself and still benefit from the struggle?</span></p>
        <p>My husband jokes that the left and right hemispheres of my brain are in a power struggle. For that, I have my parents to thank.</p>
        <p>When a kid grows up surrounded by her dad's 1970s textbooks and towering boxes of her mom's craft supplies, she’s bound to end up with some competing natures.</p>
        <p>For my ninth birthday, my favorite gift was a Smithsonian Grow-Your-Own Crystals kit (yes, that's a thing). On one hand, I was super excited about the fact that I would be in possession of my very own petri dish and beaker. At the same time, there was nothing more beautiful to me than a sparkly purple rock. Especially one I grew myself.</p>
        <p>Over time, this duality of interests began to present a problem. I was told I needed to choose: let my creativity run unbridled as a “real” artist, or focus my analytical nature into a hard skill.</p>
        <p>I never chose.</p>
        <p>Today, while my path has had a number of detours, I am thankful for that ongoing tug-of-war and for the unique perspective it gives me in every direction I take. As a portrait photographer, I bring empathy to the table, which puts my clients at ease in front of the camera. Alongside my husband, I get to give my toddler the same varied experiences my parents gave me.</p>
        <p>Now, as a UX Designer and Front-End Developer, I bring an inherited desire to hunt down solutions and an ardent need to create and craft lovely things.</p> 
        <p>Discovering a profession that allows my  to work for me is a gift, and it's one I would love to share.</p>
