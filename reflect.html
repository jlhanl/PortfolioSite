            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>Reflect sprung up out of a need I noticed during my time as a portrait and wedding photographer. On several occasions, I was approached by charitable organizations in need of photography to raise awareness for their cause. After the first time donating my services, I was hooked and began looking for other events where I could contribute to my community.</p>
            <p>This was a trend I noticed becoming more apparent throughout the saturated world of professional photographers, but while the need was certainly there, it was difficult to find without having personal connections. The one thing missing was a hub that could connect these photographers with charitable causes in need of a well-trained eye for imagery. Enter: Reflect.</p>
            <p>I wanted to design a web application that would provide photographers with a place they could go to find volunteer opportunities for causes local to them.</p>
            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>Design a web application that would provide photographers with a place they could go to find volunteer opportunities for causes local to them. Using UX principles, design it with emphasis on what would be needed to attract photographers to the site and keep them coming back.</p>

            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>From my own previous experiences, I felt that Reflect was something that would certainly benefit charities who needed photography, but I needed to make sure photographers would be interested in participating. I conducted a survey to measure interest and to get a sense of who my primary users would be.</p> 
            <p>The results gave me clear answers for me to move forward with the project and create personas based on survey responses.</p>
