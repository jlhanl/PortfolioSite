            <h3 id="black">Problem</h3>
            <p>Every morning, I would unlock my photography studio door, grab a mug of coffee, and look at what the day’s task would be for each project. Every evening, I would fill the tasks I completed with a dry erase marker, knowing that I was exactly where I needed to be in making sure my projects were up-to-date and my clients were happy.</p>
            <p>While my studio workflow chart did wondrous things to keep me on-track, it was not something I could just pull out of my pocket and reference when I was away from my desk.</p>
            <p>As a primarily on-location photographer, a good portion of my work time was spent away from my studio - sometimes meeting clients at coffee shops or waiting for my next shoot at the park. Occasionally, I'd wake at 3am, and wonder, “Did I place that order for the Pino Family?! I hope I sent Lucy and Adam their contract… I’m pretty sure I did…?” I needed a way to access my workflow chart without having to drive to the studio.</p>
            <p>I designed and developed Daily Dot to provide a digital version.</p>

            <h3 id="black">Research</h3>
            <p>As my own primary user, I had pretty good insight into what my requirements would be, and I had already completed most of my heuristic analysis through my search of a product that already existed for this purpose.</p><p>I tried multiple to-do list apps for my phone and larger-scoped CRM programs such as 17 Hats, but ultimately, I found them too cumbersome for tracking my specialized workflow. Having to type in the same workflow every time I got a new client was ineffective and often difficult to navigate, and I needed something that would work on my phone.</p><p>I also did not want to abandon my studio chart altogether for something that approached the process differently. I really enjoyed the feeling of physically filling in the dots for each task! This simple act needed to be the main point of interaction between my user and the application.</p>

            <h3 id="black">Design</h3>
            <p>The design would be simple and responsive, making it just as easy to swipe through each client project on a phone as it would be to swivel my chair at the studio. My wireframe was essentially already drawn up, in its analog form, on my wall. I added a hi-fidelity version of the desktop-view in Sketch and created a mockup of its phone-view in Illustrator.</p>

            <h3>Front-end Development</h3>
            <p>The clearest way to develop the structure of my dashboard was by using HTML tables. Knowing that HTML tables can sometimes be a bear to design, I wanted to dive straight into the code to make sure my design would be functional across multiple devices. I chose Bootstrap 3 as my site’s framework, but adding its table-responsive class merely made the table scrollable at smaller browser widths. It was a solution, but scrolling and pinching and zooming in and out on my phone made the app unusable.</p>
            <p>A user needed to be able to swipe or easily navigate from client-to-client on a phone while still being able to see the workflow task list on the left. By implementing tablesaw.js in my design, I could now open Daily Dot on my phone and swiftly navigate and reference each client project.</p>

            <h4>Future of Daily Dot</h4>
            <p>For each task's "dot" andthe lines connecting them, I used SVG canvases. I found SVGs particularly challenging to style with Javascript and jQuery. While they are functional as-is, I would love to improve my work-around. With the upcoming jQuery 3.0 release, the manipulation of SVG classes is anticipated to improve. I’m excited to test these specific improvements to refactor this aspect of the application.</p><p><a href="https://jlhanl.github.io/client-workflow">EXPLORE DAILY DOT</a></p>
